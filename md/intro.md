- The editor used in the simulator has some incredible shortcuts that can really speed up your coding.  The Ace code editor has a full list, but <a href="#" onclick='displayPage ("md/tipstricks.md")'>here are some handpicked ones that could be really useful</a>.
- Ever since its inception in January 2019, the simulator has gone through extensive testing, full rewrites, change in server software, and constant patches informed by failure data and instructor/student feedback.  The summary of these changes is called a "changelog".  The changelog for this simulator can be viewed <a href="#" onclick='displayPage ("md/changelog.md")'>here</a>.
