# Quick Start
### This simulator takes a top module, implemented in Verilog, and after syntax checks, synthesizes it, and simulates the gate-level Verilog generated from the synthesis process.  You can get started in three simple steps:
- Log in with your account details.
- Enter some Verilog code in the top module template.
- Hit Simulate!
